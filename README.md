You've already heard about blogging, we're talking about it more and more often right now. In this article, I will explain quickly what it is, and how it can be useful for you to create a blog!

### What is blogging?

Blogging is the name you use when you're blogging. A blog is used to write articles. If you have a passion for webdesign or new technologies for example, you can start a blog and write articles about this kind of topics. The goal is to share what you like to create a community of people with the same passion as you. After a while, you can even become a reference in your domain if you do well!

You should know that there are two great kinds of blog. First of all, there's the standard blog. You create it yourself, you feed it with your own content, in short, you manage it from A to Z. This style of blog is very common, since we are completely free. However, this type of blog requires a lot of work.
So if you prefer to write without worrying about the technical part, I advise you to be an editor for a collaborative blog. This kind of blog has the same features as a standard blog, except that there is a founder and several editors. Moreover, the MMI Blog is an example of a collaborative blog. The advantage is that you end up with less responsibility, besides being with a team of editors. At first, it can be a good solution to see if you are able to handle the writing of articles in the long term.

### What is it used for and what can it do for you?

Improve yourself in some areas: A blog requires a lot of skills (which we will see in the rest of the article), so if you want to get into blogging, you will automatically have to perfect yourself in certain areas. Even if at first glance, a blog seems easy to manage, it is not so simple. So if you want to make it evolve, you will inevitably acquire certain skills, which will be useful for your blog, but also for your professional life if you want to work in the web especially!

* Sharing your passion: Writing a blog allows you to express yourself in relation to some of your passions. If you are a fan of video games, fashion, cooking, or any other subject, you can share your knowledge and give your opinion. It's always good to know that we have a place where we can talk about what we like. It allows us to escape from everyday life, and just for that, it already gives you a very good reason to start a blog

* Add a project in your resume: A blog can also be very useful to show your skills. Even if it can be hard to believe, it can be a springboard for your future professional life! To give you an example, this year I have to do a two-week internship at the end of June. Well, thanks to my blog, I managed to get my internship in a communication agency. So I'll take care of the web copywriting since the agency has a blog.

* When one is in the field of the web, One must say that each project counts. In my case, I do not know if I would have had my internship without my blog. So if you want to get into blogging, while aiming for a job on the web, do not hesitate anymore

* Create new relationships: A blog can make you discover new people. You will be able to share with people with the same passions as you, and it may even offer you some opportunities after a while.

* Creating a community: When you create a blog, you have to manage your community. In this community, there will be people who will follow you, read your articles and leave messages of encouragement. It is this community that will help you to continue what you do. Plus, it will help you gain self-confidence and motivation. This is why you will need to take care of it and spend time discussing it with her.

* Make money: So yes, you can make money by doing blogging. You can offer services, sell products through an e-shop, make sponsored items (after a certain time, when you have a certain notoriety), etc. On the other hand, it is imperative to be sure that you start your blog by passion, and not just for money. Simply because a blog takes time, so it will take you more than this motivation to make it live. Passion is paramount if you want to be regular. So if you want to make a blog, start it for the right reasons.

* Be on the web: You've already heard about e-reputation. It is the reputation that you make on the web. The more you make projects on the net, the more you will enrich your e-reputation. And a blog can clearly make it take off!

* Having more self-confidence: Exposing yourself to the canvas can be frightening at first, but you will soon realize that it can bring you a lot, for your self-esteem. If you get positive feedback, some people talk about your blog, in short, you get recognition, believe me, you will take a lot of confidence in yourself. And it will motivate you to do more!

* Getting out of your house: Blogging gives more and more opportunities to get to events. Even though most of them take place in large cities, there is always a way to participate to meet other bloggers in order to interact with them. It may be nice to spend an afternoon chatting with people who share the same passions as you, and then it never hurts to talk to people outside of a screen
