### For who ?

BloggingBlogging is accessible to anyone with a desire to share their passions. And yes, even you can do it! All you have to do is choose the different themes you want to discuss in order to define your editorial line. It is very important because your readers will follow you through the subjects you are dealing with. If you talk about everything and anything, they will get tired very quickly because your content will no longer be relevant enough to them. So it is necessary to think about it from the beginning.

As said, everyone can create a blog, but know that there are still some qualities that can help you. Perseverance is one of the most important. It will serve you to keep your blog as long as possible! In the beginning everything is beautiful, you are hyper mega motivated, you see yourself go very far. But after a few weeks, the number of comments will still not take off, and your number of visits either. It is at this moment that you will have to show your perseverance!
If you are also organized, it will help you a lot in the management of your blog. You can define your editorial planning, choose niches for the writing of your articles, in short, manage it as a pro!

### The skills to be

#### Editorial skills
I think you suspect that you need to know a minimum write to hold a blog. I do not say that we must do great literature, far from it. But let's say that well constructed sentences with a minimum of spelling errors is ideal. If you can organize a text by making parts and sub-parts, it's even better! The goal is to make it easier for you to read your visitors, so your article will be clearer, the better.

#### Social abilities
A blog asks for communication. If you share some things, you will probably have returns. It is very important to answer them. If someone has bothered to leave you a message, it is normal to show that you have taken the trouble to read it.
Concerning social skills, you will also have to manage the social networks in order to share your articles in order to promote them. You will have the role of community manager! It is very important because if you do your job well, you can get new readers every time you make a new article, and that's pretty cool

#### Technical skills
Whether you're on a free platform like Blogger, or you want to have a blog with WordPress to own your own domain name, you're going to have to deal with technique. After that, there are several levels, but if you want to change the appearance of your blog for example, you will have to devote yourself to it. When I talk about techniques, I mainly think about programming, SEO and some hacks on the platform of your blog. But in any case, if you encounter difficulties, you can always search tutorials on the internet, Google is your friend

#### Artistic Skills
A blog without illustrations is a bit sad no? You will have to use your talent as a photographer to illustrate your articles! But if you're really not comfortable with this, do not panic, you can always use images free of rights, it's simple but very effective.
If you are gifted in the graphics, you can also show it by making a beautiful banner and assemblies at the top to illustrate your blog. To go further, you can even make tutorials for Photoshop or Illustrator for your readers for example!
